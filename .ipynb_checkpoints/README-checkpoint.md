+ Projec title: Who Should Biden Target?
+ This project is conducted by Yotam Segal

+ Project summary: The 2020 Elections are coming up, and campaigners are tirelessly advertising their candidate. Harnessing social media, campaign managers can target specific user profiles to optimize their reach. Using the ANES database, this research explores past cases in which an incumbent president lost when running for a second term. The Switchers, those who voted against their political alligience, are the ones who tipped the balance. This study focuses on the only two cases that ANES has data on: the 1980 elections, when Carter lost to Reagan, and the 1992 elections, when Bush lost to Clinton, and provides an image of the typical "SWitcher".
