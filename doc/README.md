# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Who Should Biden Target?

The 2020 Elections are coming up, and campaigners are tirelessly advertising their candidate. 
Harnessing social media, campaign managers can target specific user profiles to optimize their reach. 
Using the ANES database, in this research explored past cases in which an incumbent president lost when running for a second term.
The Switchers, those who voted against their political alligience, are the ones who tipped the balance. 
This study focuses on the only two cases that ANES has data on: the 1980 elections, when Carter lost to Reagan, and the 1992 elections, when Bush lost to Clinton.

I found that the typical Switcher is Young (17-24) or senior (65-74), Non-White, Southerner who lives in the Suburbs and is not college educated. She/he has average political information and cares little about the elections.
